peid-finder
===========

Will find extract a portable executable entrypoint string (up to 32 characters) from an executable for the purpose of identifying it.

Presently, this is loaded into a JS file as a requirement, and doesn't run purely from the command line.
```javascript
var peid-finder = require("peid-finder");
```
